# CS-255-Portfolio
The DriverPass project was a chance to design a system for a client who offers driving courses and test prep online. They needed a cloud-based system that students could use to register, take practice tests, and schedule appointments, while also giving different levels of access to staff like the secretary, IT officer, and the owner. I created a set of UML diagrams and technical documentation to show how the system would function and made sure the design matched what the client needed. One thing I think I did really well was connecting the user roles to the actual features they would use. It helped make the system more practical and easier to understand. I also enjoyed creating the client presentation and finding ways to explain technical ideas in a simple and non-technical audience friendly way. If I could go back and improve one part of my projects, I would probably revise the use case diagram to break down some of the actions into more detailed steps. That would have made it easier to build the activity and sequence diagrams later on. I made sure to focus on what the users needed and how they would interact with the system, which really helped guide my design. Keeping the user in mind is important because the best system is one that actually works for the people using it. In the future, I plan to use more user stories and visual planning tools to help guide my thinking. This project gave me a good look at how thoughtful planning and clear communication can lead to a better design.
